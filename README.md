## Installation

This package requires
[cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html), and so
can’t go on CRAN (nor Bioc I think). Download this repo as an R package
and install it from that.

## Usage

There’s currently only one function `run_model` that runs the model and
formats a nice excel output file. `?run_model` will show how to use it.
